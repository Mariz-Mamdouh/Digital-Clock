##Digital Clock
#Description
  The main objective of this project is to develop a digital clock that provides accurate current time and date. By utilizing the STM32 microcontroller and the ST7735 TFT LCD display , we can create a sleek and modern timepiece with various additional features.
#Hardware Components
STM32 microcontroller development board (e.g., STM32F103C8T6).
ST7735 TFT LCD display.
#Features
Display Current Time(hours,minutes,seconds).
Display Current date(day,month,year).
Utilizes SPI communication for interfacing with the TFT LCD display.
